%% INITIALIZATION

%array of linear substrate values and v0 is substrate over v0
substrateLinear = substrateConcentration;
v0Linear = substrateConcentration ./ v_initials;

% %creates array of reciprocal of substate and v0 values for Line Weaver Burk
% substrateLinear = 1 ./ substrateConcentration;
% v0Linear = 1 ./ v_initials;

%% ____________________
%% CALCULATIONS

% %Line Weaver Burk linearization for v_max and k_m
% coeffs = polyfit(substrateLinear, v0Linear, 1);
% v_max = 1 / coeffs(2);
% k_m = coeffs(1) * v_max;

% Improvement 2
% Used Hanes-Woolf instead of Lineweaver Burk to linearize the
% Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics data as it is less sensitive to errors 
% in the initial velocity measurements than the Lineweaver-Burk plot.

% Hanes-Woolf Linearization
coeffs = polyfit(substrateLinear, v0Linear, 1);
v_max = 1 / coeffs(1);
k_m = coeffs(2) / coeffs(1);
